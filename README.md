🚀 I transform ideas into impactful digital experiences through elegant websites, immersive animations and practical tools.

💻 I handle technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, MySQL, Git and GitHub. I have experience in full-stack development, REST APIs integration, automation and creating solutions for real problems.

🎨 Passionate about full-stack development, creative programming and creating educational content for developers.

🌱 Currently exploring React, Angular, Express, automation with Python, databases and deployment with Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase and Heroku.

🤝 Open to collaborate on open source projects, creative tools and anything that brings value to the dev community.
